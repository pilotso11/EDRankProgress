# EDRankProgress
EDMC Rank Progress Plugin

This plugin for Elite Dangerous Market Connector shows your progress (%) toward the next ranks for Combat, Trade, Exploration, Mercenary and Exobiology.  
It also shows your progress toward the powers Empire and Federation.

Installation is easy,
  1. Download the zip file from the Releases page
  2. Extract into our EDMC plugins folder.  Make sure it creates a new Folder called EDRankProgress.
 
# What will I see?
You will see three new lines that show your progress:

# Important Note
Elite Dangerous doesn't update the progress percentage frequently.  
You will see the progress updated for sure if you relog or if you complete a rank.

For this reason, the progress will show as 0% when you initially load the plugin.


# Options
There are options to toggle display of the rank as well as the progress.

And an option to display the rank on a separate line for a thinner window.
